# ng2-nvd3

Angular2 component for nvd3. It has similar technique as [angular-nvd3](http://krispo.github.io/angular-nvd3) for angular 1, but designed for angular 2 and without extra features (like extended mode) you won't need.

## Demos

Clone project and run `$ ng serve` for demo

## Install

    npm install git+https://github.com/newoceaninfosys/ng2-nvd3.git d3@^3 nvd3
    
it requires `angular2`, `d3` and `nvd3` as dependencies. Tested with the current `@angular` version `^4.0.0`.
    
## Basic usage

- See `src` for sample code
- IMPORTANT: you must include `nv.d3.css` to you app or you will get black background in the chart
